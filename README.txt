1)  Create the database named Streaming (CREATE DATABASE Streaming).
2)  Place the folder with the source code in the directory of XAMPP.
3)  Place the folders with the movies inside the folder "Movies"
    (the movies must be copied inside the movies folder).
4)  The films must be named with underscores instead of spaces and the second title
    must be divided with the charatcter "-".
    Example : First_title-Second_title.extension 
    If there isn't a second title , keep it null.
5)  Import the file "movie.sql" into the database "Streaming".

This site is extremely minimal , created only for LAN use but can be used in every operative system.
The streaming page uses the video player embedded in html5 ,
so , if you cant's play .avi or .flv:
right click on the player and copy the video link, then paste it on 
VLAN video player.


this site it's an alpha , so it could be not so efficient.
